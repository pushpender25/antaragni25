Where the country’s top bands put their best foot forward to compete and set the stage on fire with mind-blowing performances that electrify the environment. Over the years, Synchronicity has acted as a launchpad for some of India’s biggest rock acts including Parikrama, Them Clones, Pentagram, Blakc, The Family Cheese, Zero Gravity, and The Urban Earlymen. The event starts off with regional preliminary rounds- The ROADTRIPS, held last year in 9 major cities, including two international ones in Kathmandu and Dhaka witnessing registration from more than 800 bands. Given the current situation, we are adding a twist to the procedure and conducting the first six roadtrips in a whole new online mode. One band moves on from each zone to compete in the semi-finals held at IIT Kanpur. In the end, only the top 3 make it to the Grand Finale. The grand finale is judged by the members of the International headliner and is cheered by strong headbanging crowd of over 21,000 people! The event closes with a special performance by the international headliner. Synchronicity'19 was headlined by Skrat with a scintillating performance by the Heavy Rock band from Chennai.",
